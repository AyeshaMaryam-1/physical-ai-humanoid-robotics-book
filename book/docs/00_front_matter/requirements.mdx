# Software & Hardware Requirements

## Purpose
This chapter outlines the necessary software and hardware requirements to follow along with the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. It provides detailed specifications for local development, simulation environments, and potential real-world robot platforms.

## Learning Outcomes
After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
- Identify the minimum and recommended hardware specifications for different use cases
- Install and configure the required software tools and frameworks
- Set up cloud-based alternatives for resource-intensive tasks
- Understand the compatibility requirements between different components
- Prepare your development environment for the hands-on exercises

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of computer hardware specifications
- Familiarity with software installation procedures
- Administrative access to your development machine
- Understanding of virtualization concepts (helpful but not required)

## Inputs
- Computer or cloud instance specifications
- Software installation packages and dependencies
- Access to hardware platforms (for physical robot exercises)
- Internet connection for downloads and updates

## Outputs
- Fully configured development environment
- Verified software installations and compatibility
- Understanding of resource requirements for different tasks
- Prepared hardware platform (if applicable)

## Key Concepts
- **Development Environment**: The software stack required for creating and testing Physical AI applications
- **Simulation Requirements**: Hardware and software specifications for running physics simulations
- **AI Workload Considerations**: GPU requirements for running AI models and perception systems
- **Robot Interface Requirements**: Communication protocols and interfaces for real robot control
- **Cloud vs. Local Trade-offs**: When to use cloud resources versus local development

## Chapter Outline
This chapter is organized to guide you through the requirements for different aspects of the book:

### Hardware Requirements
- Minimum and recommended specifications for different tasks
- GPU requirements for AI and simulation workloads
- Robot platforms for hands-on exercises (simulation and physical)

### Software Requirements

- Development tools and IDEs
- Simulation environments (Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim)
- AI frameworks and libraries

### Cloud Computing Options
- Cloud providers and services for simulation
- GPU instances for AI workloads
- Containerization and orchestration platforms

## Hands-On Lab
### Local Development Setup
1. Verify your hardware specifications meet minimum requirements
2. Install required software tools and frameworks
3. Test basic functionality of each component
4. Configure development environment variables

### Cloud Development Setup
1. Set up cloud computing instance with appropriate specifications
2. Install and configure remote development tools
3. Test cloud-based simulation and AI workloads
4. Set up secure access to cloud resources

## Safety Notes
- Ensure adequate cooling for hardware during intensive simulation tasks
- Monitor system resources to prevent overheating
- Use appropriate electrical safety measures when working with physical robots
- Implement proper emergency stop procedures for all hardware platforms

## Evaluation Criteria
- Can you verify that your hardware meets the minimum requirements?
- Have you successfully installed all required software components?
- Can you run basic tests to verify functionality?
- Do you understand the resource requirements for different tasks?
- Are you prepared to scale resources as needed for more complex exercises?
