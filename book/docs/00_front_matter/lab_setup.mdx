# Lab Setup Guide (Local + Cloud)

## Purpose
This chapter provides comprehensive instructions for setting up your development environment for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book, covering both local and cloud-based options. It ensures you have all necessary tools and configurations to complete the hands-on exercises.

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Set up a local development environment with all required tools
- Configure cloud-based alternatives for resource-intensive tasks
- Verify that your environment meets all requirements
- Troubleshoot common setup issues
- Understand the differences between local and cloud development workflows

## Prerequisites
- Administrative access to your development machine
- Stable internet connection for downloads and updates
- Basic command-line familiarity
- Understanding of your system's hardware specifications

## Inputs
- Computer with appropriate specifications
- Internet connection for software downloads
- Time for installation and configuration (1-3 hours depending on system)
- Patience for potential troubleshooting

## Outputs
- Fully functional local development environment
- Alternative cloud-based development setup (optional)
- Verified installation of all required tools
- Understanding of environment-specific workflows

## Key Concepts
- **Development Environment**: Complete software stack for Physical AI development
- **Containerization**: Using Docker for consistent environments across systems
- **Cloud Computing**: Leveraging cloud resources for simulation and AI workloads
- **Version Control**: Using Git for managing code and collaboration
- **Virtual Environments**: Isolating dependencies for different projects

## Chapter Outline
This setup guide covers multiple approaches to environment configuration:

### Local Setup
1. Installing ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill or later)
2. Setting up simulation environments (Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim)
3. Installing AI frameworks and libraries
4. Configuring development tools and IDEs

### Cloud Setup
1. Setting up cloud computing instances
2. Configuring remote development environments
3. Using cloud-based simulation platforms
4. Managing cloud resources and costs

### Verification and Troubleshooting
1. Testing each component individually
2. Running sample applications
3. Common issues and solutions
4. Performance optimization tips

## Hands-On Lab
### Local Environment Setup

#### Step 1: System Preparation
1. Update your operating system to the latest stable version
2. Ensure you have sufficient disk space (at least 20GB free)
3. Verify your system meets the minimum hardware requirements

#### Step 2: Install ROS 2
```bash
# For Ubuntu 22.04 (recommended)
# Add ROS 2 repository
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl gnupg lsb-release
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-build-essential
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

#### Step 3: Install Additional Dependencies
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install numpy scipy matplotlib

# Install simulation tools
sudo apt install gazebo libgazebo-dev
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

# Install Git and version control tools
sudo apt install git git-lfs
```

#### Step 4: Set up Development Workspace
```bash
# Create ROS 2 workspace
mkdir -p ~/robotics_ws/src
cd ~/robotics_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

#### Step 5: Install AI Frameworks
```bash
# Create Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv ~/ai_env
source ~/ai_env/bin/activate
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install transformers openai-whisper
pip install tensorflow
```

### Cloud Environment Setup (Alternative)
1. Create an account with a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
2. Launch a virtual machine with Ubuntu 22.04 and appropriate GPU support
3. Follow the same installation steps as above
4. Set up SSH access for remote development
5. Configure VS Code or other IDE for remote development

## Safety Notes
- Always install software from official sources to avoid security risks
- Keep your development environment updated with security patches
- Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies
- Regularly backup important code and configurations
- Be mindful of cloud computing costs when using paid resources

## Evaluation Criteria
- Can you successfully run the ROS 2 installation verification?
- Are you able to build and run a simple ROS 2 package?
- Can you launch and interact with a basic Gazebo simulation?
- Do you have access to AI frameworks and can run basic examples?
- Is your development environment properly configured for the subsequent chapters?
