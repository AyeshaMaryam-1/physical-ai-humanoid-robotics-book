# How to Use This Book

## Purpose
This chapter provides guidance on how to effectively use this book to learn about Physical AI and humanoid robotics. It outlines the structure, learning approach, and resources available to maximize your learning experience.

## Learning Outcomes
After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
- Navigate the book's structure and understand its pedagogical approach
- Identify the optimal learning path based on your background and goals
- Utilize the hands-on exercises and practical examples effectively
- Access and use the supplementary resources and tools provided
- Set up your development environment for the practical exercises

## Prerequisites
- Basic computer literacy
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces (helpful but not required)
- Understanding of basic programming concepts (Python preferred)
- Interest in robotics and AI concepts

## Inputs
- Access to a computer capable of running simulation software
- Internet connection for downloading tools and resources
- Time and commitment to engage with both theoretical and practical content
- Willingness to experiment and learn from hands-on exercises

## Outputs
