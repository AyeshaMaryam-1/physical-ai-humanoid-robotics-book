# Preface: What is Physical AI?

## Purpose
This preface introduces the concept of Physical AI and its significance in the development of intelligent humanoid robots. Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical systems, enabling machines to perceive, reason, and act in the real world through embodied intelligence.

## Learning Outcomes
After reading this preface, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI
- Understand the relationship between AI, robotics, and embodied cognition
- Recognize the potential applications of Physical AI in humanoid robotics
- Appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of Physical AI research and development

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of artificial intelligence concepts
- Familiarity with robotics fundamentals (helpful but not required)
- Interest in the intersection of AI and physical systems

## Inputs
- Understanding of traditional AI approaches (machine learning, deep learning)
- Knowledge of robotics systems and control
- Background in sensorimotor integration concepts

## Outputs
- Clear definition and understanding of Physical AI
- Framework for thinking about embodied intelligence
- Foundation for the rest of the book's content

## Key Concepts
- **Embodied Cognition**: The idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment
- **Sensorimotor Contingencies**: The relationship between sensory input and motor output in intelligent behavior
- **Morphological Computation**: The contribution of body structure and environmental interaction to intelligent behavior
- **Affordances**: Action possibilities that emerge from the interaction between an agent's capabilities and environmental features
- **Active Inference**: The process by which agents minimize uncertainty through action and perception

## Chapter Outline
This book is organized into four modules that progressively build from foundational concepts to advanced applications:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Establishes the software foundation for robot control and communication
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explores simulation environments for robot development and testing
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Introduces advanced AI and perception systems for robotics
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Combines multiple AI modalities for complex robot behaviors

## Safety Notes
- Always consider safety implications when implementing physical AI systems
- Test in simulation before deploying on physical robots
- Implement appropriate safety limits and emergency stop mechanisms
- Follow established safety protocols for your specific robotic platform

## Evaluation Criteria
- Can you explain the difference between traditional AI and Physical AI?
- Do you understand how embodiment influences intelligent behavior?
- Can you identify examples of Physical AI applications?
- Are you prepared to engage with the interdisciplinary content that follows?
